/*An asynchronous operation executes in a thread, separate from the main application thread.
 When an application calls a method to perform an operation asynchronously, 
 the application can continue executing while the asynchronous method performs its task.*/

/*The Dart community defines a Future as "a means for getting a value sometime in the future." 
Simply put, Future objects are a mechanism to represent values returned by an expression whose execution 
will complete at a later point in time.
 Several of Dartâ€™s built-in classes return a Future when an asynchronous method is called.

Dart is a single-threaded programming language. 
If any code blocks the thread of execution (for example, by waiting for a time-consuming operation or blocking on I/O),
 the program effectively freezes.

Asynchronous operations let your program run without getting blocked. 
Dart uses Future objects to represent asynchronous operations. */
